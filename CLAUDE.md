1. If you are to create a script, group the changes and ideas into different folders. If the prompt is about modifying the Ubuntu OS setting, put the script under `os/ubuntu`. If it is something for i3 tiling mananger, put it under `apps/i3` and so on. 
You can decide the folder structure based on what the script will do.
